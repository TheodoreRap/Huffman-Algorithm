Discrete source coding method based on Huffman code using Matlab

This repository contains the following source code files:

1. HuffmanMain.m
2. myHuffmanDict.m  -  calculate Huffman codewords using an input alphabet and the corresponding odds
3. myHuffmanEnco.m  -  compress / encode a sequence of symbols into bits
4. myHuffmanDeco.m  -  decompression / decoding of a binary sequence into symbols

You can use your own "txt" and "mat" files (texts or images)
